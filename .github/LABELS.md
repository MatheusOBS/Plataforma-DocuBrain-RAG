# GitHub Label Standardization

This project uses a standard set of labels for Issues and Pull Requests to ensure consistency.

## Standard Labels

| Label            | Color     | Description                |
| :--------------- | :-------- | :------------------------- |
| `bug`            | `#d73a4a` | Something isn't working    |
| `feat`           | `#3366ff` | New feature or request     |
| `docs`           | `#0075ca` | Documentation only changes |
| `chore`          | `#a2eeef` | Build, tools, libraries    |
| `design`         | `#eb6420` | UI/UX Design changes       |
| `priority: high` | `#d93f0b` | Critical urgency           |
| `priority: low`  | `#0e8a16` | Can wait                   |

To apply these labels, we recommend using the `github-label-sync` tool or manually configuring your repo settings to match this standard.
